# Sorting-Algorithm

For this assignment you will be working in pairs. We are simply practicing our algorithmic problem solving with various javascript problems that are efficiently solved using the algorithmic frameworks discussed in class today.

We really want to practice the problem solving process so much that it is second nature to us. The attached document has the process you should be using.

DUE 10am Monday. There will be no extensions for this assignment!! (afterhours tutoring is your best friend this weekend!)

Both students will create repos for this assignment and submit.
